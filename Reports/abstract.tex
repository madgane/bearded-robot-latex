The paper addresses the scheduling of users for \ac{MU} \ac{MIMO} transmission scheme with the motive of maximizing the sum rate. The scheduling of users for MU-MIMO with a certain objective is of significant importance since the available wireless resources need to be utilized in an effective manner. Two algorithms are proposed by considering the sum rate as a maximization objective. The first scheme is based on \ac{AHP} which selects the user by evaluating the pairwise channel correlation. The second algorithm aims at reducing the complexity without compromising much on the sum rate objective. The proposed schemes are compared to the existing selection algorithms with the illustrative figures depicting the performance improvement.
