The paper addresses the iterative joint scheduling algorithms for the cooperative multi-cell \ac{MU} \ac{MIMO} scheme with the sum rate maximization objective for the cell-edge users. The \ac{QRD} scheduling, which provides near-optimal scheduling for the single-cell users, suffers significantly when performed over the cell-edge users in the multi-cell scenario. In order to improve the cell-edge user selection, we propose an iterative \ac{S-US} scheduling scheme which selects the users jointly by minimizing the interference to the neighboring \ac{BS} users. The proposed scheme provides better performance over the \ac{QRD} scheme by sharing the available \ac{DoF} with the coordinating \ac{BS}s. The extension to the \ac{S-US} scheme, namely \ac{C-US} scheme, which selects the user and the associated \ac{BS} jointly from the common user pool is discussed in the context of coordinated multi-point transmission. The simulation figures are provided in comparison with the existing scheduling schemes for the sum rate maximization objective.
