The paper addressed the scheduling of users at the cell-edge in a multi-cell environment using \ac{MU} \ac{MIMO} as the transmission scheme. We proposed \ac{S-US} scheme which selects the users for each \ac{BS} jointly in an iterative manner. The \ac{S-US} scheme performs user selection by considering the interference caused to the neighboring cell users in addition to the users already chosen in the selecting \ac{BS}. The \ac{C-US} scheme which is the generalization of \ac{S-US} scheme selects the users and the \ac{BS}s jointly over the global user set. The performance improvement of the existing schemes were significantly better than the near-optimal overloaded \ac{W-MMSE} design. The complexity of designing the precoders is also greatly reduced by doing pre-selection based on the proposed scheduling schemes using
\ac{W-MMSE} or \ac{ZF}-\ac{BF} design.
